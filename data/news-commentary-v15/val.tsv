It is that if convergence and outperformance were merely a matter of logic and destiny, as the idea of an “emerging-economy story” implies, then that logic ought also to have applied during the decades before developing-country growth started to catch the eye.	如果如“新兴市场故事”观点所隐含的那样，趋同和赶超只是一个逻辑和宿命的问题，那么这一逻辑应该也适用于发展中国家增长开始吸引人们眼球之前的几十年。

A better arms control system would undoubtedly make it more difficult for non-nuclear weapons states to acquire nuclear capability; but it is hard to see why reductions alone, however dramatic, in the huge number of American and Russian warheads should induce aspiring nuclear powers to give up their nuclear ambitions. Even if America and Russia agreed to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear warheads from 5,000-6,000 each to 1,000 each, why should that stop Iran from wanting to build 50-100 nuclear warheads and short-range delivery systems if it perceives this to be in its national interest?	一个更好的军备控制体系毫无疑问会使不拥有核武器的国家更难获得核能力；但是，很难看见单独的削减美国和俄罗斯巨量的核弹头措施 — — 不管这些措施是多么激烈 — — 会导致野心勃勃的核国家放弃他们的核野心。 即使美国和俄罗斯同意将他们分别拥有的5,000-6,000枚核弹头储备削减致各拥有1,000枚，但是，如果伊朗认为这符合其国家利益，为什么这应该阻止它寻求建造50-100枚核弹头以及短射程发射系统？
