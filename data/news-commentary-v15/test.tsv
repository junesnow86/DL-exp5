There are, of course, important, successful government programs.	当然，重要而成功的政府计划也是有的。

As Deng famously said, what mattered was not the color of the cat, but whether it caught the mice.	邓小平有句名言，不管黑猫白猫，能抓到老鼠就是好猫。

The rise of high-tech companies like Huawei, Tencent, and Alibaba is a step in the right direction, though the fact that the most successful Chinese tech companies are listed overseas, and are thus not available to mainland investors, is problematic. Regulations and exchange controls prevent the retail sector from benefiting from new wealth creation.	华为、腾讯、阿里巴巴等高科技公司的崛起是朝正确方向迈出的一步，尽管我们也需要面对一个现实问题，即这些中国最成功的科技公司都在海外上市因而无法惠及国内的投资者，监管和外汇管制阻止了个人投资从新财富创造中获益。
