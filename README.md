# Transformer-Translation-en-zh

## Introdution

The 5th experiment of Deep Learning course of USTC in 2023Fall.

The experiment requires to implement an English -> Chinese translation task with Transformer model. 

Our code refers to this [tutorial](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/581334630).

## How to Use

run `main.py` to produce results, which will train the model on 2 datasets, i.e., news-commentary-v15 and back-translation, respectively.
